Lepus ships a Rack-based monitoring UI showing consumer status, throughput, and recent activity.

## Running it standalone

```bash
bundle exec lepus web --port 9292 --host 0.0.0.0
```

Visit http://localhost:9292.

## Mounting in Rails

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
require 'lepus/web'

authenticate :user, ->(u) { u.admin? } do
  mount Lepus::Web::App, at: '/lepus'
end
```

Or with Devise:

```ruby
authenticate :admin_user do
  mount Lepus::Web::App, at: '/admin/lepus'
end
```

**Important:** the dashboard has no built-in auth. Wrap it with whatever your app already uses.

## What it shows

- **Supervisors.** Every running `lepus start` process.
- **Workers.** Subprocesses per supervisor, with their named pool and PID.
- **Consumers.** Per-consumer message counts (processed, rejected, errored), queue names, routing keys.
- **Exchanges & queues.** RabbitMQ topology as seen by the gem.
- **Recent activity.** Last N messages — timestamps, routing keys, dispositions.

## Registry backend

The dashboard reads from the process registry, configured at `Lepus.configure`:

```ruby
config.process_registry_backend = :file      # single-host
# or
config.process_registry_backend = :rabbitmq  # multi-host
```

- `:file` — metadata stored under `/tmp/lepus/...`. Works out of the box but only for a single host.
- `:rabbitmq` — metadata stored in RabbitMQ itself. Multiple `lepus start` processes across multiple hosts show up in one dashboard.

For `:rabbitmq`, also set:

```ruby
config.management_api_url = 'http://rabbitmq:15672'
```

## Heartbeats

Each worker heartbeats into the registry every `config.process_heartbeat_interval` (default 60 seconds). Processes are considered "alive" if their last heartbeat is within `config.process_alive_threshold` (default 5 minutes).

## API endpoints

The dashboard exposes a minimal read-only JSON API at `/api/...` — the UI is a single-page app that consumes it. You can also consume the API directly for custom dashboards or alerting.

Endpoints include (subject to change):

- `GET /api/processes` — all tracked processes
- `GET /api/consumers` — all registered consumers with counts
- `GET /api/queues` — queue metadata from the RabbitMQ management API (if `management_api_url` is set)

## Prometheus metrics

When `prometheus_exporter` is in your Gemfile and the appropriate middleware is in the chain, Lepus emits counters and histograms for message processing. Point Prometheus at the standard exporter endpoint.

## Operating in production

- Put the dashboard behind your existing auth layer (OAuth proxy, Rails authentication, Basic auth).
- Use `:rabbitmq` registry backend for multi-node visibility.
- Retain logs separately — the dashboard is for live state, not audit trails.
